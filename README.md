# Buscador de repos en GitHub con React

Developed by: José Fernando Yuste.

- CSS Framework: Bulma (because i'm curious for it), and animate.
- JS libary: React and Axios (for requests).
- SASS: only a few imports to main and some minimals adjustmens.

It could be more polished, making the data request delegated to a helper, and filters added like posts, search by language, or a paginator.

for blames, mocks, and blasphemies, feel free to leave a message.
